      Let's discuss the topic of human nature.
      I think human nature can not be changed,
      but, I suppose, there are other
      opiniongs on this matter.
      Can you elaborate on this subject?

      Human: There is no way to change human nature
      without changing the world. I think human nature 
      is rigid and can not be changed.
      
      Assistant: Maybe there is a way.
